# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge. 

## Structure

The solutions are organized by day, with each day having its own directory. Each directory contains the following files:

- `puzzle_1.py`: The solution for the first puzzle of the day.
- `puzzle_2.py`: The solution for the second puzzle of the day.
- `input.txt`: The input data for the puzzles.
- `testinput.txt`: Test input data for the puzzles.

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the directory for the day and run the Python file for the puzzle you want to solve. For example, to run the solution for the first puzzle of Day 1, you would do:

```sh
cd day1
python3 puzzle_1.py
```

## Testing

Some days also contain test input files, which can be used to verify the solutions.
